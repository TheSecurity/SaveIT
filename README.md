# SaveIT

SaveIT is an application which makes Game Saves Sharing easy.

The goal of this application is to create easy and simple environment which supports games with locally hosted saves.

### The Problem

I think everyone knows situations when you want to play with your friends and one of you has to host the game (the game save is stored on host's computer). When you want to play again you have to wait untill the host starts the server again... and again...

This scenario can get very boring soon. Imagine you want to play more often than your host so you ask him after every gaming session to don't forget to upload your save somewhere so you are able to download it and host it.

### The Solution

SaveIT is an application that
- Allows users to share their Game saves using well known services as Google Disc.
- Thanks to Upload and Download features sharing your progress consists of two clicks!
- Save conflict prevention - the app ensures that only one user can use a game save at a time.

### Save sharing in three simple steps

1. Download save
2. Play
3. Upload save

*All above features are included in the SaveIT app.*
